In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. "},{"count":1,"name":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

It s easy to assume that every police department everywhere are working on ways to stop BLM in their tracks, but that s not true. There is at least one department that actually sees BLM quite differently.Earlier this week, Phoenix Black Lives Matter hosted a forum in which police officers, and other community leaders, were invited to speak. The Phoenix Police Department s assistant chief, Mike Kurtenbach, said outright: The Phoenix Police Department doesn t see Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization. We view Black Lives Matter as a partner who holds us accountable.We stand with you to find solutions. There s no way to respond to that but with cheers, and Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton reinforced that by telling the diverse crowd that they re looking to have a very diverse police department, and they want people to apply to work in their department. More diversity can mean more accountability, which means changing policing for the better. Working with BLM as a partner, instead of fighting them as a terrorist group, also leads to better policing.We re full of people mostly conservative who believe that BLM is specifically waging a war against cops, though BLM actually decries that violence. They want to remain peaceful. Yet, our conservative leaders, particularly those at the Republican National Convention right now, scream about Black Lives Matter being inherently racist, as Donald Trump himself said. Then again, from a white supremacist, that s not too surprising, but it s disgusting that so many in the GOP agree with him.There s also Rudy Guiliani, who claims to have saved a lot more lives with his broken windows policy than Black Lives Matter ever did. He said: I don t see what Black Lives Matter is doing for blacks other than isolating them. All it cares about is the police shooting of blacks. It doesn t care about the 90 percent of blacks that are killed by other blacks. We don t see how he cares about black lives at all. New York City s broken windows policing model has led to a very, very racist department that targets members of the black community for really stupid stuff far more than white people.Then there are some police departments that see BLM as a threat, and any support of them as a gross insult, almost along the lines of people spitting on soldiers returning from a war they disagree with. For instance, the Somerville, Mass. department is calling for the removal of a Black Lives Matter banner from City Hall like it s the Confederate flag. Their union actually said: The Somerville Police Employees Association and its members are deeply troubled that the city continues to display the Black Lives Matter banner above the main entrance of City Hall. It is inconceivable to us as it is demoralizing that our city would propagate its support for this movement while standing silent over the seemingly daily protest assassinations of innocent police officers around the country. The people who cry,  All lives matter,  really don t get why the movement specifies the black community. Some lives in this country matter more than others here. Given the rate at which unarmed black people are shot by police, are arrested and incarcerated by our justice system, and how they re perceived as guilty until proven innocent, their lives matter considerably less than other lives.That is an undisputable fact.So it s very refreshing to see a police department that s willing to work with BLM on improving policing by seeing them as a partner in this, rather than as a hostile movement that incites terrorism and insults police officers by its very existence. We need a lot more of this.Featured image via Phoenix Police Department"},{"count":3,"name":"3 others"}],"nan_count":0,"unique_count":5}},{"dtype":"object","name":"subject","stats":{"categories":[{"count":2,"name":"worldnews"},{"count":1,"name":"politics"},{"count":2,"name":"2 others"}],"nan_count":0,"unique_count":4}},{"dtype":"object","name":"date","stats":{"categories":[{"count":1,"name":"Oct 25, 2016"},{"count":1,"name":"July 21, 2016"},{"count":3,"name":"3 others"}],"nan_count":0,"unique_count":5}},{"dtype":"int64","name":"label","stats":{"histogram":[{"bin_end":0.1,"bin_start":0,"count":3},{"bin_end":0.2,"bin_start":0.1,"count":0},{"bin_end":0.30000000000000004,"bin_start":0.2,"count":0},{"bin_end":0.4,"bin_start":0.30000000000000004,"count":0},{"bin_end":0.5,"bin_start":0.4,"count":0},{"bin_end":0.6000000000000001,"bin_start":0.5,"count":0},{"bin_end":0.7000000000000001,"bin_start":0.6000000000000001,"count":0},{"bin_end":0.8,"bin_start":0.7000000000000001,"count":0},{"bin_end":0.9,"bin_start":0.8,"count":0},{"bin_end":1,"bin_start":0.9,"count":2}],"max":"1","min":"0","nan_count":0,"unique_count":2}},{"dtype":"bool","name":"label_meaning","stats":{"categories":[{"count":3,"name":"False"},{"count":2,"name":"True"}],"nan_count":0,"unique_count":2}},{"dtype":"int64","name":"_deepnote_index_column"}],"row_count":5,"rows":[{"_deepnote_index_column":0,"date":"Oct 25, 2016","label":0,"label_meaning":"False","subject":"politics","text":"Remember Combetta is Hillary s Oh Sh*t IT guy:BREAKING: FEMALE LAW STUDENT Busts Hillary s  Oh Sh*t  IT Guy Who Was Seeking Help To Scrub Hillary s Name From Emails Wikileaks Applauds!The same day that President Barack Obama publicly insisted that he learned about Hillary Clinton s use of private email for government business from news reports, internal campaign emails show that Clinton staffers knew he wasn t telling the truth.Obama was asked by CBS in March 2015 when he learned about Clinton s use of  an email system outside the U.S. government for official business  as Secretary of State.

in dallas and baton rouge, which blm had zilch to do with. it s easy to assume that every police department everywhere are working on ways to stop blm in their tracks, but that s not true. there is at least one department that actually sees blm quite differently.earlier this week, phoenix black lives matter hosted a forum in which police officers, and other community leaders, were invited to speak. the phoenix police department s assistant chief, mike kurtenbach, said outright: the phoenix police department doesn t see black lives matter as a terrorist organization. we view black lives matter as a partner who holds us accountable.we stand with you to find solutions. there s no way to respond to that but with cheers, and phoenix mayor greg stanton reinforced that by telling the diverse crowd that they re looking to have a very diverse police department, and they want people to apply to work in their department. more diversity can mean more accountability, which means changing policing for the better. working with blm as a partner, instead of fighting them as a terrorist group, also leads to better policing.we re full of people mostly conservative who believe that blm is specifically waging a war against cops, though blm actually decries that violence. they want to remain peaceful. yet, our conservative leaders, particularly those at the republican national convention right now, scream about black lives matter being inherently racist, as donald trump himself said. then again, from a white supremacist, that s not too surprising, but it s disgusting that so many in the gop agree with him.there s also rudy guiliani, who claims to have saved a lot more lives with his broken windows policy than black lives matter ever did. he said: i don t see what black lives matter is doing for blacks other than isolating them. all it cares about is the police shooting of blacks. it doesn t care about the 90 percent of blacks that are killed by other blacks. we don t see how he cares about black lives at all. new york city s broken windows policing model has led to a very, very racist department that targets members of the black community for really stupid stuff far more than white people.then there are some police departments that see blm as a threat, and any support of them as a gross insult, almost along the lines of people spitting on soldiers returning from a war they disagree with. for instance, the somerville, mass. department is calling for the removal of a black lives matter banner from city hall like it s the confederate flag. their union actually said: the somerville police employees association and its members are deeply troubled that the city continues to display the black lives matter banner above the main entrance of city hall. it is inconceivable to us as it is demoralizing that our city would propagate its support for this movement while standing silent over the seemingly daily protest assassinations of innocent police officers around the country. the people who cry,  all lives matter,  really don t get why the movement specifies the black community. some lives in this country matter more than others here. given the rate at which unarmed black people are shot by police, are arrested and incarcerated by our justice system, and how they re perceived as guilty until proven innocent, their lives matter considerably less than other lives.that is an undisputable fact.so it s very refreshing to see a police department that s willing to work with blm on improving policing by seeing them as a partner in this, rather than as a hostile movement that incites terrorism and insults police officers by its very existence. we need a lot more of this.featured image via phoenix police department"},{"count":3,"name":"3

racist department that targets members of the black community for really stupid stuff far more than white peoplethen there are some police departments that see blm as a threat and any support of them as a gross insult almost along the lines of people spitting on soldiers returning from a war they disagree with for instance the somerville mass department is calling for the removal of a black lives matter banner from city hall like it s the confederate flag their union actually said the somerville police employees association and its members are deeply troubled that the city continues to display the black lives matter banner above the main entrance of city hall it is inconceivable to us as it is demoralizing that our city would propagate its support for this movement while standing silent over the seemingly daily protest assassinations of innocent police officers around the country the people who cry all lives matter really don t get why the movement specifies the black community some lives in this country matter more than others here given the rate at which unarmed black people are shot by police are arrested and incarcerated by our justice system and how they re perceived as guilty until proven innocent their lives matter considerably less than other livesthat is an undisputable factso it s very refreshing to see a police department that s willing to work with blm on improving policing by seeing them as a partner in this rather than as a hostile movement that incites terrorism and insults police officers by its very existence we need a lot more of thisfeatured
